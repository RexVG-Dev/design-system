# Design System - Button & Modal Components

This is a simple design system that includes reusable components for a Button and a Modal built with React. The components are designed with accessibility in mind and are styled using SCSS modules

## Components

### Button
A flexible button component that supports different variants (primary, secondary, link), sizes (small, medium, large, fluent), and accessibility features like aria-label.

Usage:
```
import { Button, VARIANT, SIZE } from '@components/Button';

<Button
  variant={VARIANT.primary}
  size={SIZE.medium}
  ariaLabel="Submit"
  onClick={handleClick}
>
  Submit
</Button>
```
### Modal
A customizable modal component with a header, content area, and optional footer with action buttons. The modal supports accessibility features like aria-labelledby and aria-label, and it handles closing with the Escape key or by clicking the overlay.

Usage:
```
import { Modal } from '@components/Modal';

<Modal
  isOpen={isModalOpen}
  onClose={handleCloseModal}
  ariaLabel="Modal to confirm action"
  title="Confirm Action"
  footer={{
    primary: {
      text: 'Confirm',
      ariaLabel: 'Confirm action',
      onClick: handleConfirm,
    },
    secondary: {
      text: 'Cancel',
      ariaLabel: 'Cancel action',
      onClick: handleCancel,
    },
  }}
>
  <p>Are you sure you want to perform this action?</p>
</Modal>

```

## Features
  - **Accessibility:** The components are designed with accessibility in mind. Proper aria-label, aria-modal, and role attributes are set for keyboard navigation and screen reader users.
  - **Customization:** Easily customize the buttons with variants and sizes, and modals with optional footer actions.
  - **Responsiveness:** The components adapt to different screen sizes and are styled using SCSS modules with CSS variables for easy theming.

## ðŸ“˜ Storybook
This project uses Storybook to visualize and test component use cases in isolation. It allows you to browse components in isolation

Run Storybook locally
```
npm run storybook
```

This will launch Storybook at **http://localhost:6006** (by default), where you can explore the **Button** and **Modal** components interactively.

Feel free to explore the documented use cases.
When adding new components or features, make sure to create corresponding stories in Storybook.
Refer to the existing Button and Modal stories as examples for future integrations.
